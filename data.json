I have been allergic to Olay products in the past so I was trepidacious about using this combo. Well, I love this product. It goes on beautifully. It stays where you put it, and looks great after several hours of wear. No allergic reaction. The sponge is easy to clean. HOWEVER, I strongly suggest you listen to the bloggers who tell you that the shades are much darker than you think they might be. I normally wear a Porcelain 20 in Lancome so I purchased Natural Ivory #215. It is still considerably darker than what I usually wear. I will be purchasing a lighter shade (if they have one) and keep this one for facial contouring. Give it a try. (If you are very young or have oily skin it may not be for you.)",
